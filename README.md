# RainbowR

RainbowR is a community that supports, promotes and connects LGBTQ+ people who code in the R language.
Not every work or social environment is safe or supportive for LGBTQ+ people, so the need to have a dedicated community continues.

## Our Mission

Our mission is to support, promote and connect LGBTQ+ people in the R community and to and spread awareness of LGBTQ+ issues through data-driven activism.

## Involvement

We welcome everyone, LGBTQ+ or not, who is interested in promoting LGBTQ+ people and issues in the R community and beyond, to follow and engage with us on Twitter, [\@R_LGBTQ](https://twitter.com/R_LGBTQ).
